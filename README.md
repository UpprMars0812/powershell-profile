# üé® PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell)

A fork of Chris Titus Tech's PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell) (powershell-profile) repo.
This PowerShell 7.0+ and Windows PowerShell profiles provides a stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

***The Windows PowerShell profile that is made entirely based from the existing PowerShell 7.0+ is currently under development. You may use this on your Windows PowerShell environment however installing this profile would require you to do it manually.***

## ‚ö° One Line Install

**PowerShell 7.0 or newer:**

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell 7.0 or greater window to install the PowerShell profile:

```
irm "https://github.com/UpprMars0812/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

***The One Line Install script for the legacy Windows PowerShell will be available soon.***

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the required nerd fonts:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! üöÄ
